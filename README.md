**The Problem: Determining the Installation of Distribution Centers**
A logistics company must analyze and determine whether or not to build a set of distribution centers to store and subsequently transport raw materials supplied by its clients.

The company has 50 clients from whom it purchases agricultural raw materials. These clients are located in different provinces across the country. Each client produces a fixed annual amount, which is sold to the company.

To optimize its operating costs, the company is analyzing the potential location of eight distribution centers situated in various parts of the country. Each distribution center is planned to be located on a road or railway line, so that the raw material can later be transported to ports for export. Each distribution center has a projected annual operating cost. This cost is independent of the annual volume of raw material it handles.

The clients and potential distribution centers are connected through various routes. The routes connect clients with other clients and with some distribution centers. Not all clients are directly connected to a distribution center, but they may be connected to other clients. The layout is similar to the one shown in Figure 1 of the appendix.

The total transportation cost per client for raw materials is determined by the minimum unit cost of transporting the raw material from the client to the corresponding distribution center, plus the unit cost of transporting it from that distribution center to the port. This total is then multiplied by the clientâ€™s annual production volume. The total annual cost is the sum of the total costs for all clients.

Objectives of the Practical Assignment
The objectives of the practical assignment are:

- Determine which distribution centers should be built in order to minimize the total annual cost.

- Determine to which distribution center each client should send their raw materials.
